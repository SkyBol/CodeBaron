This is my 'über-app' that oversees all my other apps!
Down below are some listed that are either implemented, are currently being implemented, or are planned:

This is a silly little App that helps organizing by being chaotig itself :D

It allows uploading different types of media, and labeling each upload with tags. No complicated settup, easy and fast usage.
